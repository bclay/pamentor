We think hackathons should be about learning and meeting new people, so we’re here to make it happen. Read all about our initiatives, and join us for a new kind of mentoring experience!


## [Beginner Guides](//mentoring.pennapps.com/guide)
To help you learn to hack and learn new technologies, we have our archive of tech talks and guides developed by the team on lots of useful topics.

## [Dining Philosophers](http://dinphil.github.io) Resources

PennApps has teamed up with the Dining Philosophers (Penn's CS club) to teach new hackers the basics of hacking! The Dining Philosophers has a bunch of homegrown workshops and tutorials on all sorts of useful subjects for new hackers like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. [Click here](http://dinphil.github.io) to see all the information from the tutorials, including slides, and code samples. We particularly recommend the [Code Weekend](//dinphil.github.io/code-weekend) series of workshops that are a brilliant intro to Web Development.
