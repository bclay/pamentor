We think hackathons should be about learning and meeting new people, so we’re here to make it happen. Read all about our initiatives, and join us for a new kind of mentoring experience!


## [Beginner Guides](//mentoring.pennapps.com/guide)
To help you learn to hack and learn new technologies, we have our archive of tech talks and guides developed by the team on lots of useful topics.

## Workshops at PennApps


At PennApps, we host several events for both our new and experienced hackers. Friday night, we will have intro to hacking talks on topics like Civic Hacking, User Centered Design, Intro to Web Dev, Android, and iOS. We also have additional workshops on Saturday afternoon on the topics of Machine Learning APIs, Data Innovation and Its Role in Healthcare, Hardware, Ruby, and What Investors Don't Tell You About Pitching. [You can find the schedule here](http://2016f.pennapps.com/files/2016f_program.pdf).

There will be a team formation event on Friday night for both Hacker Guru teams and regular teams. A women’s meetup will occur on Saturday as well. Times and locations for the workshops can be found in your program or under logistics on pennapps.com. You can also find mentors in the Mentor Hub (Engineering Cafe) for most of the weekend!

## [Dining Philosophers](http://dinphil.github.io) Resources

PennApps has teamed up with the Dining Philosophers (Penn's CS club) to teach new hackers the basics of hacking! The Dining Philosophers has a bunch of homegrown workshops and tutorials on all sorts of useful subjects for new hackers like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. [Click here](http://dinphil.github.io) to see all the information from the tutorials, including slides, and code samples. We particularly recommend the [Code Weekend](//dinphil.github.io/code-weekend) series of workshops that are a brilliant intro to Web Development.
